## 🔍 CONTROL & PRESSURE CALCULATION LOGIC:

### **Pressure Percentage:**
```python
def calculate_pressure(delta, volume):
    """Calculate buying/selling pressure percentage"""
    if volume <= 0:
        return 50, 50  # neutral
    
    # Delta as percentage of volume
    delta_pct = delta / volume
    
    # Convert to buy/sell percentages
    buy_pct = (1 + delta_pct) / 2 * 100
    sell_pct = 100 - buy_pct
    
    return buy_pct, sell_pct

# Example: Delta +14.59, Volume 65.90
# delta_pct = 14.59/65.90 = 0.22 (22% net buying)
# buy_pct = (1 + 0.22)/2 * 100 = 61%
# sell_pct = 39%
```

### **Control Determination:**
```python
def determine_control(buy_pct):
    """Determine who's in control based on pressure"""
    if buy_pct >= 65:
        return "🟢 BUYER CONTROL", buy_pct
    elif buy_pct <= 35:
        return "🔴 SELLER CONTROL", 100 - buy_pct
    else:
        return "⚪ BALANCED", max(buy_pct, 100 - buy_pct)
```

### **Intelligence Signals:**
```python
def generate_intelligence(spot_pressure, perp_pressure, volume_ratio, price_change):
    """Generate market intelligence summary"""
    signals = []
    
    # Price action analysis
    avg_pressure = (spot_pressure + perp_pressure) / 2
    if avg_pressure > 75 and abs(price_change) < 0.1:
        signals.append("Strong Support" if avg_pressure < 0 else "Strong Resistance")
    
    # Volume context
    if volume_ratio > 2:
        signals.append("High Activity")
    elif volume_ratio > 1.5:
        signals.append("Above Average")
    
    # Exhaustion patterns
    if avg_pressure > 80:
        signals.append("Seller Exhaustion" if avg_pressure < 0 else "Buyer Climax")
    
    return " | ".join(signals)
```
