## TECHNICAL DECISIONS & RATIONALE

### 1. Standalone vs Full Integration Tests
**Decision**: Create both standalone and full integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Standalone tests run without infrastructure (CI/CD friendly)
- Full tests validate complete system including WebSocket/Redis
- Provides flexibility for different testing environments

### 2. Mock Redis Implementation
**Decision**: Implement mock Redis for tests
**Rationale**:
- Allows testing without Redis installation
- Validates graceful degradation
- Enables CI/CD without external dependencies
- Tests Redis integration logic

### 3. Comprehensive Test Data Generator
**Decision**: Build sophisticated test data generator
**Rationale**:
- Realistic scenarios improve test quality
- Reproducible tests (seeded random)
- Multiple scenario types cover edge cases
- Statistical validation of generated data

### 4. Performance Report Format
**Decision**: Markdown report with detailed sections
**Rationale**:
- Easy to read and navigate
- Version controlled
- Can be converted to PDF/HTML
- Includes executive summary and technical details

### 5. Conservative Cascade Detection
**Decision**: Accept 33% false positive rate initially
**Rationale**:
- Safety-critical system (better to over-alert)
- Can be tuned with production data
- 100% true positive rate is critical
- False positives can be reduced post-launch
