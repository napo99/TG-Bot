- Agent 2 & 3 integrate their engines
- Orchestrator reviews and resolves conflicts

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (Day 4)
- Agent 4 runs comprehensive tests
- All agents fix issues found
- Performance optimization based on profiling

### Phase 4: Final Integration (Day 5)
- Orchestrator performs final review
- End-to-end validation
- Documentation completion

## 🔐 Critical Constraints

### Must Preserve:
