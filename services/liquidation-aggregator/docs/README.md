# Documentation Index

- `hyperliquid_liquidation_detection.md` – current plan for dynamic liquidation detection.
- `archive/` – legacy implementation notes, handover summaries, and investigation reports kept for reference.

The top-level repository now only carries active documentation; anything historical lives under `docs/archive/`.
