## What You're Seeing

```
2025-10-21 23:29:07,072 - cascade_detector - WARNING -
🚨 CROSS-EXCHANGE CASCADE DETECTED: BTCUSDT |
   16 liquidations | $164,763 | Risk: 0.51 |
   Exchanges: binance, bybit
```

## ✅ This is NOT an Error!

These are **CASCADE ALERTS** - they indicate your system is detecting significant liquidation events in real-time. This is **exactly what you want!**

---

## 🎯 What is a Liquidation Cascade?

A **cascade** occurs when:
1. Multiple liquidations happen in a short time window (60 seconds)
2. Total value exceeds institutional threshold ($100,000)
3. Minimum number of liquidations (5+) occur

**Why it matters:**
- Indicates significant market movement
- Can trigger further liquidations (chain reaction)
- Often precedes price volatility
- Useful for trading signals

## 🎯 Risk Score Explained

The risk score (0.0 to 2.0+) is calculated using **6 factors**:

### 1. **Volume Concentration** (25% weight)
- Higher dollar value = higher risk
- $1M+ = maximum score

### 2. **Time Compression** (20% weight)
- More events per minute = higher risk
- 10+ events/minute = maximum score

### 3. **Price Clustering** (20% weight)
- Liquidations at similar prices = higher risk
- Indicates stop-loss clusters

### 4. **Side Imbalance** (15% weight)
- All longs OR all shorts = higher risk
- Indicates one-sided market

### 5. **Institutional Ratio** (15% weight)
- More large ($500K+) liquidations = higher risk
- Indicates institutional involvement

### 6. **Exchange Diversity** (5% weight)
- Multi-exchange cascades = higher systemic risk
- Cross-exchange = more significant event

## 📈 Risk Score Guide

| Score | Severity | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **0.0 - 0.3** | Low | Small retail cascade, limited impact |
| **0.3 - 0.6** | Medium | Moderate cascade, watch closely |
| **0.6 - 1.0** | High | Significant cascade, potential volatility |
| **1.0+** | Critical | Major cascade event, extreme risk |

**Your alerts (0.49-0.51):** Medium severity - significant but not extreme.

## 🎯 What to Do With Cascade Alerts

### For Trading:
1. **Watch for price movements** when cascades occur
2. **Higher risk scores** = more significant moves
3. **Cross-exchange cascades** = broader market impact
4. **Multiple cascades** in sequence = sustained pressure

### For Analysis:
1. **Log all cascades** to database (already happening)
2. **Correlate with price movements**
3. **Build cascade patterns database**
4. **Create predictive models**

### For Alerts:
1. **Set thresholds** (e.g., Risk > 0.8)
2. **Send notifications** (Discord/Telegram)
3. **Trigger automated actions**
