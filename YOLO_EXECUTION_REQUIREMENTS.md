# üöÄ YOLO EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CONSOLIDATION

## üéØ **MISSION CONTEXT**

**Target Environment**: LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (crypto1/@napo_assistant_bot)
**Current Status**: Running with "temporarily disabled dynamic system" (confirmed via logs)
**Scope**: Consolidate 4 competing liquidation systems ‚Üí 1 unified institutional-grade system
**Risk Level**: LOW (local development, not production AWS)

---

## üìã **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION**

### **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS**
```bash
# YOLO AGENT MUST VERIFY:
docker ps | grep crypto-telegram-bot | grep "Up"
# Expected: crypto-telegram-bot container running

curl -s http://localhost:8001/health | jq '.status'  
# Expected: "healthy"

docker logs crypto-telegram-bot --tail 5 | grep "temporarily disabled"
# Expected: Multiple "Using institutional fallback thresholds" messages
# This confirms we're in the broken state that needs consolidation
```

### **ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION**
```bash
# Verify we're in correct development environment
echo $TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN | head -c 10
# Should show crypto1 bot token (NOT production AWS token)

# Verify local market data service
curl -s http://localhost:8001/price -d '{"symbol":"BTC-USDT"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# Should return price data successfully
```

---

## üîß **EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. EXTERNAL VALIDATION MANDATE**
```
YOLO AGENT MUST SPAWN EXPERT VALIDATION AGENTS:

Agent 1: Senior Software Architect
- Validate architectural consolidation approach
- Confirm no institutional features lost
- Approve unified system design

Agent 2: Trading Systems Expert  
- Verify Bloomberg Terminal-level capabilities preserved
- Validate cascade prediction algorithms
- Confirm institutional threshold calculations

Agent 3: Docker/DevOps Specialist
- Validate container deployment strategy
- Confirm zero-downtime switchover approach
- Verify rollback procedures

ALL THREE AGENTS MUST APPROVE BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES
```

### **2. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING REQUIREMENT**
```bash
# MANDATORY TEST SEQUENCE (All must pass):

# Test 1: Import Validation
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('/app')
from shared.intelligence.unified_liquidation_core import LiquidationIntelligenceEngine
engine = LiquidationIntelligenceEngine(None)
print('‚úÖ Unified core import successful')
print(f'üìä Institutional thresholds: {len(engine.institutional_thresholds)} assets')
assert len(engine.institutional_thresholds) >= 5, 'Insufficient threshold coverage'
"

# Test 2: Threshold Calculation Validation
python3 -c "
from shared.intelligence.unified_liquidation_core import LiquidationIntelligenceEngine
engine = LiquidationIntelligenceEngine(None)
btc_thresholds = engine.calculate_adaptive_threshold('BTCUSDT')
assert btc_thresholds['base'] >= 300000, 'BTC threshold too low'
assert btc_thresholds['cascade'] >= 1000000, 'BTC cascade threshold too low'
print('‚úÖ Institutional thresholds validated')
"

# Test 3: WebSocket Connection Test (30 second validation)
timeout 30s python3 -c "
import asyncio
from shared.intelligence.unified_liquidation_core import LiquidationIntelligenceEngine

class MockBot:
    async def send_message(self, *args, **kwargs): pass

async def test():
    engine = LiquidationIntelligenceEngine(MockBot())
    task = asyncio.create_task(engine.start_unified_monitoring())
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    if 'binance' in engine.websocket_connections:
        print('‚úÖ WebSocket connection established')
        await engine.stop_monitoring()
        return True
    return False

result = asyncio.run(test())
assert result, 'WebSocket connection failed'
"

# Test 4: Docker Integration Test
docker-compose build telegram-bot
docker-compose up -d telegram-bot
sleep 15
docker logs crypto-telegram-bot --tail 10 | grep -E "(institutional|unified)" || echo "‚ùå Unified system not starting"

# Test 5: End-to-End Health Check
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health && echo "‚úÖ Market data healthy"
docker logs crypto-telegram-bot --tail 5 | grep -v "temporarily disabled" && echo "‚úÖ Dynamic system conflicts resolved"
```

### **3. DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**
```bash
# MANDATORY DEPLOYMENT CHECKS (All must pass):

# Memory usage check (should be <512MB)
docker stats crypto-telegram-bot --no-stream --format "table {{.MemUsage}}" | tail -1

# Log validation (no errors in past 2 minutes)
docker logs crypto-telegram-bot --since="2m" | grep -i error | wc -l
# Expected: 0 errors

# WebSocket connection stability (5 minute test)
timeout 300s docker logs crypto-telegram-bot -f | grep "WebSocket connected\|Institutional alert sent" || echo "Connection stable"
```
