### 🔧 **Advanced Features (IN PROGRESS)**
- [ ] **Volume Spike Alerts** - `/alert-volume BTC 200` (>200% volume spike detection)
- [ ] **OI Threshold Alerts** - `/alert-oi BTC-PERP 50000` (OI crosses threshold)
- [ ] **CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta)** - Buy/sell pressure analysis
- [ ] **Volume Spike Detection Algorithm** - Smart detection of significant volume
- [ ] **Basic Technical Indicators** - RSI, VWAP, ATR, Bollinger Bands
- [ ] **Alert Management System** - List, edit, delete alerts

### 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

#### **Volume Spike Detection Algorithm**
```python
# Detect significant volume spikes
def detect_volume_spike(current_volume, lookback_periods=96):  # 24h of 15min candles
    """
    - Compare current 15min volume to moving average
    - Detect spikes >200%, >300%, >500%
    - Account for time-of-day patterns
    - Filter out regular market open/close spikes
    """
```

#### **CVD Implementation**
```python
# Cumulative Volume Delta calculation
def calculate_cvd(ohlcv_data):
    """
    - Use tick data if available, or approximate with OHLCV
    - Green candle = +volume, Red candle = -volume
    - Track cumulative buying vs selling pressure
    - Detect divergences with price action
    """
```

#### **Smart Alert System**
```python
# Multi-factor alert conditions
/alert-volume BTC 200 15m     # 200% spike in 15min timeframe
/alert-oi BTC-PERP +10000     # OI increases by 10k BTC
/alert-cvd ETH negative       # CVD turns negative (selling pressure)
```

## 🎖 **Current Phase 1 Achievements**

### **✅ Major Issues Resolved**
1. **Fixed `/top10 perps` Empty Results**
   - **Problem**: Wrong exchange configuration
   - **Solution**: Added `binance_futures` with `'defaultType': 'future'`
   - **Result**: Now returns comprehensive perp data with OI + funding rates

2. **Fixed Market Cap Calculation**
   - **Problem**: Used wrong `price × volume` calculation
   - **Solution**: Implemented real market cap ranking system
   - **Result**: Correct rankings (BTC $2.1T, ETH $306B, etc.)

3. **Enhanced Volume Display**
   - **Problem**: Unclear volume representation
   - **Solution**: Show both native tokens AND USD equivalent
   - **Result**: "7,281 BTC ($768.5M)" format

### **📈 Current Metrics**
- **Test Suite**: 8/8 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **API Response Time**: 225ms average
- **Market Coverage**: 3000+ symbols (spot + perpetuals)
- **Data Accuracy**: Real-time Binance data with proper formatting

## 🚀 **Next Phase 1 Implementations**

### **1. Volume Spike Alert System** (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Smart volume detection
/alert-volume BTC 200 15m    # Alert if 15min volume >200% of avg
/alert-volume ETH 300 1h     # Alert if 1h volume >300% of avg
/volume-spikes               # Show current volume spikes across markets
```

**Technical Approach:**
- Fetch historical volume data (96 periods = 24h of 15min candles)
- Calculate rolling average and standard deviation
- Detect spikes accounting for time-of-day patterns
- Smart filtering to avoid false positives during market hours

### **2. OI Threshold Alerts** (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# OI monitoring for perpetuals
/alert-oi BTC-PERP +50000    # Alert when OI increases by 50k BTC
/alert-oi ETH-PERP 2000000   # Alert when ETH OI crosses 2M
/oi-changes                  # Show recent OI changes across perps
```

### **3. CVD Implementation** (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Cumulative Volume Delta
/cvd BTC-USDT 4h            # Show 4h CVD for BTC
/cvd-alerts                 # CVD divergence alerts
```

**CVD Calculation:**
- Green candle (close > open): +volume (buying pressure)
- Red candle (close < open): -volume (selling pressure)
- Track cumulative buying vs selling over time
- Detect divergences between CVD and price
