# üö® CRITICAL: STOP ALL ASSUMPTIONS - EVIDENCE REQUIRED

## üìä **SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE COLLECTION REQUIRED**

You are **100% correct** - I have been making assumptions without proof for 48 hours. This is unacceptable. 

### **IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS:**

#### **1. EXACT PROOF OF WORKING STATE**
- [ ] **Git commit hash** of last confirmed working deployment
- [ ] **Exact date/time** with evidence (logs, screenshots, user confirmation)
- [ ] **Complete code diff** between working and current state
- [ ] **Dependencies analysis** - what changed

#### **2. COMPLETE FILE AUDIT** 
- [ ] **Every single file** categorized with purpose
- [ ] **Fly.io pollution identification** - systematic removal plan
- [ ] **AWS-specific files** - validation and cleanup
- [ ] **Test/debug files** - removal candidates

#### **3. DEPENDENCY MAPPING**
- [ ] **All Python imports** analyzed and validated
- [ ] **All environment variables** documented
- [ ] **All Docker configurations** understood
- [ ] **Memory/resource requirements** measured (not assumed)

#### **4. VALIDATION FRAMEWORK**
- [ ] **Architect approval** required at each phase
- [ ] **Tester validation** required before deployment
- [ ] **No code changes** without evidence-based plan
- [ ] **Rollback plan** tested and ready

## üéØ **EXECUTION PLAN - EVIDENCE FIRST**

### **PHASE 1: EVIDENCE COLLECTION (Required Before Any Action)**

```bash
# Execute evidence collection (READ-ONLY analysis)
./evidence_collection.sh

# Review all generated evidence files
# Present findings to architect for validation
# Get tester agreement on criteria
```

### **PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC CLEANUP (Only After Approval)**

**Files to DELETE (Fly.io Pollution):**
- `fly.Dockerfile`
- `fly.toml` 
- `services/telegram-bot/fly.webhook.toml`
- Any other Fly.io files (to be identified in evidence)

**Files to REVIEW (Potential Pollution):**
- All `emergency_*.py` files
- All `*test*.py` files outside tests/
- All temporary analysis files

### **PHASE 3: RECOVERY (Only After Complete Validation)**

**Step-by-step recovery with validation points:**
1. **Baseline establishment** (with backup)
2. **Local testing** (with memory profiling)
3. **AWS deployment** (with monitoring)
4. **End-to-end validation**

## üî¨ **VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS**

### **Architect Validation Required:**
- [ ] **Evidence collection complete** - All files categorized
- [ ] **Cleanup plan approved** - No essential files deleted
- [ ] **Recovery strategy approved** - Step-by-step plan validated
- [ ] **Each phase completion** - Before proceeding to next

### **Tester Validation Required:**
- [ ] **Functionality baseline** - Document current state
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** - Memory/speed measurements
- [ ] **Test plan approved** - Validation criteria agreed
- [ ] **Deployment success** - All features working

## üö® **CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **BEFORE ANY CODE/CONFIG CHANGES:**
1. ‚úÖ **Complete evidence collection** with proof
2. ‚úÖ **Architect approval** on analysis and plan
3. ‚úÖ **Tester approval** on validation criteria
4. ‚úÖ **Dependencies fully mapped** and understood
5. ‚úÖ **Rollback plan tested** and ready

### **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS METRICS:**
1. ‚úÖ **Bot responds to commands** within defined timeframes
2. ‚úÖ **Memory usage within limits** (actual measurements)
3. ‚úÖ **No errors in logs** for sustained period
4. ‚úÖ **All enhanced features functional** as designed

---

## üìù **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

**ALL actions must include:**
- **Exact timestamps** of all activities
- **Complete command outputs** with logs
- **Before/after evidence** (screenshots, measurements)
- **Error messages** with full context
- **Validation results** from both architect and tester

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**

1. **Execute evidence collection script** (READ-ONLY)
2. **Review all generated evidence files**
3. **Present complete analysis to architect**
4. **Get explicit approval before ANY changes**
5. **Document everything with timestamps and proof**

**NO MORE ASSUMPTIONS. NO MORE WASTED TIME. EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH ONLY.**

*Estimated completion time: 2-3 hours for complete evidence-based recovery (vs 48 hours of assumptions)*
