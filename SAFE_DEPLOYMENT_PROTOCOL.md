# üõ°Ô∏è SAFE DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

## Current Problem
- Direct commits to aws-deployment branch
- No merge process through main
- High risk of breaking production
- Missing features and bugs in production

## New Safe Workflow

### 1. Development Flow
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Develop and test locally
# ... make changes ...
docker-compose up -d  # Test locally

# Commit to feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### 2. Integration Flow  
```bash
# Merge to main first (REQUIRED)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/your-feature --no-ff
git push origin main

# Then merge main to aws-deployment (safer)
git checkout aws-deployment  
git merge main --no-ff
git push origin aws-deployment  # This triggers deployment
```

### 3. Emergency Rollback
```bash
# If production breaks
git checkout aws-deployment
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
git push origin aws-deployment --force
```

## Benefits
- ‚úÖ All code reviewed in main first
- ‚úÖ Can test main branch before production  
- ‚úÖ Clear history of what went to production
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback if issues arise
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental production breaks

## Current State Recovery
1. Stop making direct commits to aws-deployment
2. Merge aws-deployment back to main to sync
3. Fix the delta calculation bug
4. Test everything in main first
5. Then deploy to aws-deployment

## Testing Requirements  
Before any production deployment:
- ‚úÖ Local docker-compose test passes
- ‚úÖ All commands work correctly (/price, /analysis, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Data calculations are mathematically correct
- ‚úÖ No obvious bugs or formatting issues
