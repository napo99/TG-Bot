## 1. VELOCITY CALCULATIONS

### 1.1 Events Per Second (First Derivative)

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, lines 168

```python
events_per_second = event_count / window
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Multiple timeframe analysis
timeframes = {
    'ultra_fast': 0.1,    # 100ms
    'fast': 0.5,          # 500ms
    'normal': 2.0,        # 2 seconds
    'medium': 10.0,       # 10 seconds
    'slow': 60.0,         # 60 seconds
    'macro': 300.0        # 5 minutes
}

# For each timeframe:
current_time = time.time()
recent_events = [
    e for e in self.events[timeframe]
    if current_time - e['time'] <= window
]
event_count = len(recent_events)
events_per_second = event_count / window
```

**Example Calculations:**

```
Scenario 1: Normal Market
- Timeframe: 2 seconds (normal)
- Events in window: 4 liquidations
- Velocity: 4 / 2.0 = 2.0 events/second
- Status: Normal (below 10 events/s warning threshold)

Scenario 2: Elevated Activity
- Timeframe: 2 seconds
- Events in window: 25 liquidations
- Velocity: 25 / 2.0 = 12.5 events/second
- Status: WARNING (10 < x < 50)

Scenario 3: Cascade Event
- Timeframe: 100ms (ultra_fast)
- Events in window: 8 liquidations
- Velocity: 8 / 0.1 = 80 events/second
- Status: CRITICAL (exceeds 50 events/s threshold)
```

**Thresholds:**
- Normal: < 10 events/second
- Warning: 10-50 events/second
- Critical: 50+ events/second

### 1.2 Volume Per Second (Dollar Velocity)

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, line 172

```python
volume_per_second = total_volume / window
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Calculate total USD value of liquidations in window
total_volume = sum(e['size_usd'] for e in recent_events)
volume_per_second = total_volume / window
```

**Example Calculations:**

```
Scenario 1: Small Liquidations
- Timeframe: 2 seconds
- Total Volume: $500K
- Velocity: $500,000 / 2.0 = $250,000/second
- Status: Normal (below $10M/s warning)

Scenario 2: Large Liquidations
- Timeframe: 2 seconds
- Total Volume: $15M
- Velocity: $15,000,000 / 2.0 = $7,500,000/second
- Status: WARNING (between $10M and $50M)

Scenario 3: Market Shock
- Timeframe: 100ms (ultra_fast)
- Total Volume: $100M
- Velocity: $100,000,000 / 0.1 = $1,000,000,000/second
- Status: EXTREME CRITICAL
```

**Thresholds:**
- Normal: < $10M/second
- Warning: $10M-$50M/second
- Critical: $50M+ /second

### 1.3 Multi-Timeframe Analysis

The system analyzes velocity across 6 simultaneous timeframes:

```
Ultra-Fast (100ms):
  Detects: Flash crashes, micro-cascades
  Example: 10 events in 100ms = 100 events/second

Fast (500ms):
  Detects: High-speed momentum cascades
  Example: 15 events in 500ms = 30 events/second

Normal (2s):
  Detects: Standard cascade formation
  Example: 25 events in 2s = 12.5 events/second

Medium (10s):
  Detects: Position unwinding
  Example: 50 events in 10s = 5 events/second

Slow (60s):
  Detects: Trend changes
  Example: 60 events in 60s = 1 event/second

Macro (5m):
  Detects: Market regime shifts
  Example: 100 events in 300s = 0.33 events/second
```

## 2. ACCELERATION CALCULATIONS

### 2.1 Events Acceleration (Second Derivative)

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, lines 185-190

```python
events_acceleration = (
    events_per_second - prev_metrics.events_per_second
) / dt
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Only calculated if we have history (2+ measurements)
if len(self.metric_history) >= 2:
    prev_metrics = self.metric_history[-1]  # Previous measurement
    current_metrics = current calculation  # New measurement
    
    dt = current_time - prev_metrics.timestamp
    
    if dt > 0:
        events_acceleration = (
            current_metrics.events_per_second - 
            prev_metrics.events_per_second
        ) / dt
```

**Example Calculations:**

```
Scenario 1: Stable Velocity
- T=0s: 5 events/second
- T=0.1s: 5 events/second (no change)
- Acceleration: (5 - 5) / 0.1 = 0 events/s²
- Status: No acceleration (no cascade forming)

Scenario 2: Moderate Acceleration
- T=0s: 10 events/second
- T=0.1s: 15 events/second
- Acceleration: (15 - 10) / 0.1 = 50 events/s²
- Status: WARNING (5 < x < 20)

Scenario 3: Extreme Acceleration
- T=0s: 20 events/second
- T=0.1s: 60 events/second (3x increase)
- Acceleration: (60 - 20) / 0.1 = 400 events/s²
- Status: CRITICAL/EXTREME

Scenario 4: Deceleration (Good Sign)
- T=0s: 50 events/second
- T=0.1s: 30 events/second
- Acceleration: (30 - 50) / 0.1 = -200 events/s²
- Status: Cascade ending
```

**Thresholds:**
- Low acceleration: < 5 events/s²
- Warning acceleration: 5-20 events/s²
- Critical acceleration: 20+ events/s²

### 2.2 Volume Acceleration (Dollar Velocity Change)

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, line 190

```python
volume_acceleration = (
    volume_per_second - prev_metrics.volume_per_second
) / dt
```

**Implementation:**
```python
volume_acceleration = (
    current_$/s - previous_$/s
) / time_delta

# Units: $/second²
```

**Example Calculations:**

```
Scenario 1: Stable Dollar Volume
- T=0s: $5M/second
- T=0.1s: $5M/second
- Acceleration: ($5M - $5M) / 0.1 = $0/s²
- Status: Stable

Scenario 2: Rapid Volume Increase
- T=0s: $10M/second
- T=0.1s: $50M/second (5x increase)
- Acceleration: ($50M - $10M) / 0.1 = $400M/s²
- Status: CRITICAL - massive volume acceleration

Scenario 3: Volume Spike
- T=0s: $5M/second
- T=0.05s: $100M/second
- Acceleration: ($100M - $5M) / 0.05 = $1,900M/s²
- Status: EXTREME
```

## 3. CASCADE PROBABILITY SCORING

### 3.1 Weighted Combination

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, lines 258-285

The system combines multiple signals with professional weights:

```python
weights = {
    'velocity': 0.25,        # 25% - Raw event speed
    'acceleration': 0.20,    # 20% - Momentum increase
    'volume': 0.20,          # 20% - Dollar magnitude
    'correlation': 0.15,     # 15% - Multi-exchange sync
    'funding': 0.10,         # 10% - Leverage pressure
    'open_interest': 0.10    # 10% - OI dynamics
}
```

**Normalization Process:**

```python
# Scale each metric to 0-1 range
velocity_score = min(1.0, velocity / threshold_critical)
accel_score = min(1.0, abs(acceleration) / threshold_critical)
volume_score = min(1.0, volume / threshold_critical)

# Example normalization
# velocity = 75 events/s, critical threshold = 50
velocity_score = min(1.0, 75 / 50) = min(1.0, 1.5) = 1.0 (capped)

# acceleration = 25 events/s², critical threshold = 20
accel_score = min(1.0, abs(25) / 20) = min(1.0, 1.25) = 1.0 (capped)
```

**Probability Calculation:**

```python
probability = (
    velocity_score * 0.25 +
    accel_score * 0.20 +
    volume_score * 0.20 +
    correlation * 0.15
)

# Non-linear boost for extreme acceleration
if acceleration > critical_threshold:
    probability = min(1.0, probability * 1.5)

# Final probability: 0.0 to 1.0
```

**Example Cascade Probability:**

```
Scenario: Moderate Cascade
- Events: 30/s (capped at 1.0) × 0.25 = 0.25
- Acceleration: 12/s² (0.6) × 0.20 = 0.12
- Volume: $25M/s (0.5) × 0.20 = 0.10
- Correlation: 0.8 × 0.15 = 0.12
- Subtotal: 0.59

Acceleration boost: 12 < 20, no boost
Final Probability: 59% cascade probability
Signal Level: ALERT (50-70% range)
```

## 4. CASCADE SIGNAL LEVELS

### 4.1 Signal Determination Logic

**Location:** `professional_cascade_detector.py`, lines 287-319

```python
def _determine_signal_level(
    cascade_prob: float,
    velocity: float,
    volume: float,
    acceleration: float
) -> CascadeSignal:
```

**Signal Hierarchy:**

```
EXTREME (Risk Level: Catastrophic)
├── Probability > 90% OR
├── Velocity > 100 events/s (2x critical) OR
└── Volume > $100M/s (2x critical)

CRITICAL (Risk Level: High)
├── Probability > 70% OR
├── Velocity > 50 events/s AND Acceleration > 20/s² simultaneously

ALERT (Risk Level: Moderate)
├── Probability > 50% OR
└── Velocity > 20 events/s (2x warning threshold)

WATCH (Risk Level: Low)
├── Probability > 30% OR
└── Velocity > 10 events/s (meets warning threshold)

NONE (Risk Level: Normal)
└── All metrics below watch thresholds
```

**Example Signal Determination:**

```
Scenario 1: Fast Flash Crash
- Probability: 85%
- Velocity: 120 events/s
- Volume: $75M/s
- Acceleration: 150 events/s²
Result: EXTREME (multiple extreme indicators)

Scenario 2: Moderate Cascade
- Probability: 65%
- Velocity: 45 events/s
- Volume: $20M/s
- Acceleration: 12 events/s²
Result: CRITICAL (probability > 70% or dual threshold)

Scenario 3: Forming Cascade
- Probability: 48%
- Velocity: 22 events/s
- Volume: $15M/s
- Acceleration: 5 events/s²
Result: ALERT (probability > 50% boundary)

Scenario 4: Elevated Activity
- Probability: 25%
- Velocity: 8 events/s
- Volume: $8M/s
- Acceleration: 2 events/s²
Result: NONE (all metrics below thresholds)
```

## 5. TIME-WINDOWED CALCULATIONS

### 5.1 Open Interest Velocity

**Location:** `market_data_aggregator.py`, lines 224-230

```python
# Calculate OI change rate over different windows
for timeframe, seconds in [('1m', 60), ('5m', 300), ('1h', 3600)]:
    past_oi = next(
        (h['oi'] for h in self.oi_history
         if current_time - h['time'] >= seconds),
        current_oi
    )
    changes[f'change_{timeframe}'] = (
        (current_oi - past_oi) / past_oi * 100
    ) if past_oi else 0
```

**Example OI Velocity:**

```
Current OI: $1,000,000,000
OI 1 minute ago: $1,020,000,000
1-minute OI change: ($1,000M - $1,020M) / $1,020M × 100 = -1.96%

Interpretation:
- OI dropping 2% per minute indicates rapid position closing
- Could signal cascading liquidations ahead
```

### 5.2 Funding Rate Acceleration

**Location:** `binance_bybit_oi_service.py`, `market_data_aggregator.py`

```python
# Funding rates history (288 points = 24h at 5-min intervals)
self.funding_history = deque(maxlen=288)

# Track trend
if len(self.funding_history) > 10:
    recent = [h['rate'] for h in list(self.funding_history)[-10:]]
    
    if recent[-1] > recent[0] * 1.1:  # 10% increase
        trend = 'increasing'  # Rates rising = more leverage
    elif recent[-1] < recent[0] * 0.9:  # 10% decrease
        trend = 'decreasing'  # Rates falling = reducing leverage
    else:
        trend = 'neutral'
```

**Example Funding Trend:**

```
Scenario: Escalating Leverage
- 1h ago: Funding +0.05% per 8h
- Now: Funding +0.12% per 8h
- Acceleration: +0.07% (140% increase)
- Trend: INCREASING
- Signal: Markets getting more overleveraged

Risk Assessment:
- Increasing funding + rising velocity = cascade risk multiplier
- Both metrics trending same direction amplifies cascade probability
```

## 8. TUNING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Threshold Adjustments

```
For High-Volatility Assets (e.g., Altcoins):
- Increase velocity warning: 15 events/s
- Increase acceleration warning: 8 events/s²
- Increase volume warning: $15M/s
Rationale: More noise, need higher bars

For Institutional Systems:
- Keep tight thresholds (current)
- Focus on acceleration over velocity
- Weight correlation more heavily (20%)
Rationale: Cascade often coordinated, not just volume spike

For Retail Platforms:
- Increase all thresholds 50%
- Focus more on volume than events
- Adjust weights: velocity 20%, acceleration 15%, volume 30%
Rationale: Liquidations more scattered, less synchronized
```

### 8.2 Timeframe Optimization

```
For Flash Crash Detection:
- Add: 50ms timeframe
- Remove: 5m timeframe
Rationale: Faster detection, less macro noise

For Trend Following:
- Add: 30s timeframe
- Add: 10m timeframe
Rationale: Catch mid-trend formations

For Risk Management:
- Keep all current timeframes
- Add cross-timeframe correlation
Rationale: Multi-scale risk assessment
```
