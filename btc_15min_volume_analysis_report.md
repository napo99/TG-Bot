### 3. Volume Pattern Classification

**Current Status:** NORMAL_VOLUME
- Pattern falls within normal range (0.5x - 2.0x average)
- No significant volume spikes detected
- Slight below-average activity overall

### 4. Crypto Assistant Integration

**Endpoint Testing Results:**
- ✅ `/comprehensive_analysis` - Functional with volume data
- ✅ `/volume_spike` - Functional but limited data
- ✅ `/debug_tickers` - Functional for debugging

**Crypto Assistant Volume Analysis:**
- Current Volume: 130.36 BTC (slight difference from raw API)
- Volume USD: $14,127,915
- Spike Level: NORMAL
- Spike Percentage: 47.13%
- Relative Volume: 1.44x

## Technical Analysis Context

### Volume Patterns
1. **Normal Distribution:** Current volume is 0.73x the 24h average
2. **Market Dominance:** Futures volume is 5.5x spot volume
3. **Timeframe Relevance:** 15m data provides good granularity for spike detection

### Comparison with Market Data Service
The crypto assistant's volume analysis shows:
- Relative volume: 1.44x (compared to historical average)
- Spike percentage: 47.13% (below significance threshold)
- Classification: NORMAL (no anomalies)

## Recommendations for Volume Analysis

### 1. Baseline Calculation
- Use 96 candles (24 hours) for 15m average calculation
- Consider both spot and futures volumes for complete picture
- Apply 2x average threshold for significant spike detection

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- **HIGH_VOLUME:** > 2.0x average (significant activity)
- **NORMAL_VOLUME:** 0.5x - 2.0x average (typical range)
- **LOW_VOLUME:** < 0.5x average (quiet period)

### 3. Context Considerations
- Monitor futures/spot ratio for market behavior insights
- Track volume USD value for absolute impact assessment
- Consider time-of-day patterns for more accurate baselines

### 4. Integration Opportunities
- Crypto assistant already provides good volume spike detection
- 15m timeframe is optimal for real-time analysis
- Additional context could include:
  - Intraday volume patterns
  - Cross-exchange volume comparison
  - Volume-price divergence analysis
