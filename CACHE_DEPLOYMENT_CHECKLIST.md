## Deployment Steps

### 🔧 **Step 1: Deploy Cached Service**

```bash
# Build cached service
docker-compose build market-data-cached

# Start cached service (parallel deployment)
docker-compose up -d market-data-cached

# Verify service is running
docker ps | grep crypto-market-data-cached
```

**Expected Result**: Service starts within 30 seconds

### 🔍 **Step 2: Health Check**

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "cached-market-data",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "cache_enabled": true,
  "cache_stats": {
    "hit_rate": 0,
    "entries": 0,
    "memory_mb": 0
  }
}
```

- [ ] Service responds with 200 status
- [ ] `cache_enabled` is `true`
- [ ] No error messages in logs

### 📊 **Step 3: Cache Statistics**

```bash
# Check cache stats
curl http://localhost:8001/cache/stats

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cache_stats": {
      "hit_rate": 0.0,
      "entries": 0,
      "memory_mb": 0.0,
      "hits": 0,
      "misses": 0,
      "evictions": 0
    }
  }
}
```

- [ ] Cache stats endpoint responds successfully
- [ ] Initial values are zero (expected for cold cache)
- [ ] No configuration errors

### 🧪 **Step 4: Functional Testing**

```bash
# Test basic price endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/price \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol": "BTC/USDT"}'

# Test comprehensive analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/comprehensive_analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol": "BTC/USDT", "timeframe": "15m"}'
```

- [ ] Price endpoint returns valid data
- [ ] Comprehensive analysis endpoint works
- [ ] Response times recorded (baseline)
- [ ] No errors in service logs

### ⚡ **Step 5: Performance Testing**

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
cd /services/market-data
python cache_test_suite.py
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Overall score > 80%
- [ ] Performance grade: B or higher
- [ ] Reliability grade: B or higher
- [ ] No critical test failures

### 📈 **Step 6: Cache Warming**

```bash
# Warm cache for popular symbols
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/cache/warm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbols": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT", "SOL/USDT"]}'
```

- [ ] Cache warming completes successfully
- [ ] Cache stats show increased entries
- [ ] Hit rate improves on subsequent requests

### 🔄 **Step 7: Performance Validation**

```bash
# Test same request multiple times
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s \
    -X POST http://localhost:8001/comprehensive_analysis \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"symbol": "BTC/USDT", "timeframe": "15m"}'
done
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] First request: 500ms-1500ms (cold cache)
- [ ] Subsequent requests: 50ms-200ms (warm cache)
- [ ] 80%+ performance improvement observed

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 🔍 **Step 8: Monitor Cache Health**

```bash
# Check cache health status
curl http://localhost:8001/cache/health

# Expected healthy status:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "metrics": {
    "hit_rate": 75.0,
    "memory_usage_percent": 25.0,
    "avg_response_time_ms": 100.0
  },
  "active_alerts": 0
}
```

- [ ] Status is "healthy"
- [ ] Hit rate > 50% after warmup
- [ ] Memory usage < 80%
- [ ] No active alerts

### 📊 **Step 9: Performance Monitoring**

```bash
# Get performance trends
curl http://localhost:8001/cache/performance?hours=1

# Check optimization recommendations
curl http://localhost:8001/cache/recommendations
```

- [ ] Performance trends show improvement
- [ ] No critical recommendations
- [ ] System operating within expected parameters

### 🛡️ **Step 10: Stress Testing**

```bash
# Run concurrent requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/comprehensive_analysis \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"symbol": "BTC/USDT", "timeframe": "15m"}' &
done
wait
```

- [ ] All requests complete successfully
- [ ] Response times remain consistent
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes
- [ ] Service remains stable

## Production Cutover

### 🔄 **Step 11: Traffic Migration**

**Option A: Direct Cutover**

# Update telegram bot to use cached service
# (Already configured to use same port)
```

**Option B: Gradual Migration**
```bash
# Use load balancer or proxy to split traffic
# Start with 20% traffic to cached service
# Gradually increase to 100%
```

- [ ] Migration strategy selected
- [ ] Backup plan prepared
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

### 📋 **Step 12: Final Validation**

```bash
# Test all endpoints through cached service
