## Key Takeaways

### System Strengths
1. **Real-time processing:** <1ms latency, never blocks
2. **6 exchanges covered:** Binance, Bybit, OKX, Hyperliquid, GateIO, Bitget
3. **Professional cascade detection:** Multi-signal scoring with acceleration tracking
4. **Memory efficient:** 18 bytes per liquidation, <10MB for 100 symbols
5. **Non-blocking persistence:** Background database writes, never blocks real-time
6. **Dynamic exchange support:** Auto-detects new exchanges from Redis

### Current Limitations
1. No per-exchange velocity breakdown
2. Limited side-based (LONG vs SHORT) acceleration
3. No funding rate acceleration tracking
4. No cross-symbol cascade detection
5. Reactive (not predictive)

### Quick Wins for Enhancement
1. Add exchange-specific velocity tracking (< 1 hour)
2. Implement side-based acceleration (< 2 hours)
3. Add OI velocity ($/second) (< 1 hour)
4. Add funding rate acceleration (< 30 min)
