## Key Metrics Summary

### Velocity Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Events/second | count / window | 10/s | 50/s |
| Volume/second | USD / window | $10M/s | $50M/s |
| Events Accel | (vel₂ - vel₁) / dt | 5/s² | 20/s² |
| Volume Accel | ($/s₂ - $/s₁) / dt | - | High |

### Open Interest Changes
| Window | Formula | Signal |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 1-minute | (OI_now - OI_1m_ago) / OI_1m_ago % | Position closing |
| 5-minute | Same calculation over 5m | Trend shift |
| 1-hour | Same calculation over 1h | Regime change |

### Funding Rate Tracking
| Metric | Calculation | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Current Rate | Latest snapshot | Leverage level |
| Trend | Compare last 10 snapshots | Direction (rising/falling) |
| 24h Max | Peak in history | Extreme leverage detection |

## Cascade Detection System

### Signal Levels
```
EXTREME:  Probability > 90% OR Velocity > 100 events/s
CRITICAL: Probability > 70% OR (Velocity > 50/s AND Accel > 20/s²)
ALERT:    Probability > 50% OR Velocity > 20 events/s
WATCH:    Probability > 30% OR Velocity > 10 events/s
NONE:     All below watch thresholds
```

### Probability Calculation
```
Weighted combination of:
- Velocity (25%)
- Acceleration (20%)
- Volume (20%)
- Cross-exchange correlation (15%)
- Funding rate (10%)
- Open interest delta (10%)

Each metric normalized 0-1, summed with weights
Boost applied for extreme acceleration
Final score: 0.0 to 1.0
```

### Time Windows Analyzed Simultaneously
- **100ms** - Flash crash detection
- **500ms** - Momentum detection
- **2 seconds** - Standard cascades
- **10 seconds** - Position unwinding
- **60 seconds** - Trend changes
- **5 minutes** - Regime shifts

---

## Exchange-Specific Logic

### Side Detection (LONG vs SHORT)

**Binance:**
- SELL order = LONG liquidation
- BUY order = SHORT liquidation

**Bybit:**
- Sell = LONG liquidation
- Buy = SHORT liquidation

**OKX:**
- posSide 'long' = LONG liquidation
- posSide 'short' = SHORT liquidation

**Hyperliquid:**
- Detect HLP liquidator address (0x2e3d94f...)
- HLP buying = SHORT closing
- HLP selling = LONG closing

---

## Production-Ready Features

### What Works Well
1. **Real-time ingestion** - All major exchanges covered
2. **6-exchange OI aggregation** - Parallel fetching, validation
3. **Professional cascade detection** - Multi-signal scoring
4. **Memory optimization** - 18-byte records, ring buffers
5. **Non-blocking architecture** - Real-time never blocked
6. **Dynamic exchange support** - Auto-detection from Redis

### Current Limitations
1. No per-exchange velocity breakdown
2. Limited side-based acceleration metrics
3. No funding rate acceleration tracking
4. No cross-symbol cascade detection
5. Limited order flow metrics

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority

2. Implement side-based acceleration tracking
3. Add OI velocity ($/second) calculations
4. Track funding rate acceleration

### Medium Priority
1. Cross-symbol cascade detection
2. Machine learning early warning system
3. Order flow imbalance metrics
4. Whale wallet concentration tracking

### Low Priority
1. Options data integration (IV, skew)
2. On-chain liquidation propagation tracking
3. Custom alert configurations per asset

## Quick Start: Adding New Metrics

### Example: Exchange-Specific Velocity

```python
# In professional_cascade_detector.py

def _calculate_exchange_velocity(self, exchange: str) -> float:
    """Calculate events per second for specific exchange"""
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Get events for this exchange in last 2 seconds
    recent = [
        e for e in self.exchange_events[exchange]
        if current_time - e.get('time', 0) <= 2.0
    ]
    
    return len(recent) / 2.0  # events per second

# Add to LiquidationMetrics:
exchange_velocity: Dict[str, float] = {}  # exchange -> events/s

# Use in cascade detection:
for exchange in self.exchange_events:
    velocity = self._calculate_exchange_velocity(exchange)
    metrics.exchange_velocity[exchange] = velocity
    
    # Detect exchange leading the cascade
    if velocity > 20:  # 20 events/s from single exchange
        metrics.leading_exchange = exchange
```
